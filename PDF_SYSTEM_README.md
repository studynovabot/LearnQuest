                  || (request.auth != null && 
                      (request.auth.token.subscriptionPlan == 'pro' || 
                       request.auth.token.subscriptionPlan == 'goat'));
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                      request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PDF Processing Fails**
- Ensure `pdf-parse` is installed
- Check PDF file is not corrupted
- Verify file size limits
- Check console for detailed errors

**Firebase Upload Fails**
- Verify service account key is correct
- Check Firestore security rules
- Ensure project ID is correct
- Check network connectivity

**Access Control Not Working**
- Verify user tier in headers
- Check role-based logic
- Ensure authentication tokens include subscription info
- Test with different user accounts

**AI Help Not Working**
- Verify user has Pro/Goat access
- Check AI API integration
- Ensure proper error handling
- Test with mock responses first

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check API health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health-check

# Test PDF upload (requires form data)
# Use Postman or similar tool

# Check Firebase connection
node -e "console.log(process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID)"

# Run specific test
node test-pdf-flow.js
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Recommendations
1. **PDF Processing**: Use worker threads for large files
2. **Firebase**: Implement caching for frequently accessed solutions
3. **AI Help**: Rate limiting and response caching
4. **Frontend**: Lazy loading and pagination
5. **Search**: Implement full-text search with Algolia

### Monitoring
- Set up Firebase performance monitoring
- Track PDF processing times
- Monitor user engagement metrics
- Alert on failed uploads/processing

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **File Upload**: Validate file types and sizes
2. **Access Control**: Implement proper JWT verification
3. **Firebase**: Use security rules and admin SDK
4. **AI API**: Rate limiting and usage monitoring
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information
