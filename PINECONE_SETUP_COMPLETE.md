## 🎯 How Students Will Use It

### Upload Process:
1. **Go to Content Manager** (`/content-manager`)
2. **Select metadata** (subject, class, chapter)
3. **Upload PDF files** (drag & drop)
4. **System processes** and stores in Pinecone automatically

### Search Process:
1. **Go to NCERT Solutions** (`/ncert-solutions`) or Document Search (`/document-search`)
2. **Enter search query** (e.g., "photosynthesis process")
3. **Get ranked results** from uploaded documents
4. **View relevant content** with similarity scores

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Pinecone Settings:
- **Index Name**: `learnquest-documents`
- **Dimension**: 1536 (OpenAI ada-002 compatible)
- **Metric**: Cosine similarity
- **Environment**: GCP Starter (free tier)

### Features Enabled:
- ✅ Real-time document upload
- ✅ Vector similarity search
- ✅ Metadata filtering (subject, chapter, user)
- ✅ Chunked document processing
- ✅ Relevance scoring
- ✅ User-specific document libraries

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing:
1. Visit `/vector-db-test` to verify everything works
2. Upload a test PDF in `/content-manager`
3. Search for content in `/document-search`

### For Production:
1. **Add OpenAI API Key** for better embeddings:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ```
2. **Monitor Pinecone usage** in your dashboard
3. **Scale index** if needed for more documents

### Optional Enhancements:
- Add OCR for scanned PDFs
- Implement document sharing between users
- Add advanced filtering options
- Create document summaries with AI

## 🎉 Success Metrics

After testing, you should see:
- ✅ Pinecone connection successful
- ✅ Documents uploading to vector database
- ✅ Search returning relevant results
- ✅ Similarity scores showing relevance
- ✅ Integration with existing UI themes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Connection Fails:
1. Check Pinecone dashboard for index status
2. Verify API key is correct
3. Ensure index name matches configuration

### If Upload Fails:
1. Check file size (max 50MB)
2. Verify file type is supported
3. Check browser console for errors

### If Search Returns No Results:
1. Ensure documents are uploaded first
2. Try broader search terms
3. Check user authentication
