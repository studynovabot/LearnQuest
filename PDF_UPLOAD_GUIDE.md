# 📚 Complete PDF Upload Guide - Vector Database

## 🎯 **How Students Upload PDFs to Vector Database**

### **Method 1: Using the Upload Page** 🖥️

#### **Step 1: Navigate to Upload Page**
- Go to `/vector-upload` in your LearnQuest app
- You'll see a comprehensive upload interface

#### **Step 2: Select Files**
- **Drag & Drop**: Drag PDF files directly onto the upload area
- **Click to Select**: Click "Select Files" button to browse files
- **Multiple Files**: Upload multiple PDFs at once

#### **Step 3: Add Metadata**
For each file, students fill out:
- **Title**: Name of the document (auto-filled from filename)
- **Subject**: Choose from dropdown (Math, Physics, Biology, etc.)
- **Chapter**: Optional chapter information

#### **Step 4: Upload to Vector Database**
- Click "Upload to Vector Database" button
- Files are processed and split into searchable chunks
- Progress shown for each file
- Success confirmation with chunk count

### **Method 2: Using Content Manager** 📁

#### **Alternative Upload Route:**
- Go to `/content-manager`
- Use the existing file upload interface
- Files automatically processed through vector database

### **Method 3: Using Vector DB Test Page** 🧪

#### **For Testing:**
- Go to `/vector-db-test`
- Upload test content to verify system works
- Search uploaded content immediately

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Frontend Upload Flow:**
```typescript
// 1. File Selection
const handleFileSelect = (files: FileList) => {
  // Validate files
  // Create metadata forms
}

// 2. Process Each File
const processPDF = async (file: File, metadata: FileMetadata) => {
  // Extract text from PDF
  const text = await extractTextFromPDF(file);
  
  // Send to vector database API
  const response = await fetch('/api/vector-upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-user-id': userId
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      content: text,
      metadata: metadata
    })
  });
}
```

### **Backend Processing:**
```javascript
// api/vector-upload.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  // 1. Receive content and metadata
  const { content, metadata } = req.body;
  
  // 2. Chunk the text
  const chunks = chunkText(content, 1000, 200);
  
  // 3. Generate embeddings for each chunk
  chunks.forEach(chunk => {
    const embedding = generateTextEmbedding(chunk);
    
    // 4. Store in Firebase with embedding
    db.collection('vector_documents').add({
      content: chunk,
      embedding: embedding,
      metadata: metadata
    });
  });
}
```

## 📱 **User Experience Flow**

### **What Students See:**

#### **1. Upload Interface**
- Clean drag-and-drop area
- File validation feedback
- Progress indicators
- Metadata forms for each file

#### **2. Processing Feedback**
- "Processing..." status for each file
- Chunk count when complete
- Success/error messages
- XP rewards for uploads

#### **3. Immediate Testing**
- Switch to test tab after upload
- Search uploaded content
- See similarity scores
- Verify AI can access their documents

## 🎯 **Supported File Types**

### **Primary Support:**
- ✅ **PDF Files** (.pdf) - Main target
- ✅ **Text Files** (.txt) - Direct text
- ✅ **Word Documents** (.doc, .docx) - With conversion

### **File Constraints:**
- **Max Size**: 50MB per file
- **Text Requirement**: Must contain readable text
- **Language**: English text works best

## 🔍 **How Vector Database Works**

### **1. Text Extraction**
```javascript
// Extract text from PDF
const text = await extractTextFromPDF(file);
// Result: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants..."
```

### **2. Text Chunking**
```javascript
// Split into manageable chunks
const chunks = chunkText(text, 1000, 200);
// Result: ["Photosynthesis is the process...", "The light reactions occur..."]
```

### **3. Embedding Generation**
```javascript
// Create searchable embeddings
const embedding = generateTextEmbedding(chunk);
// Result: [0.1, -0.3, 0.7, ...] (384-dimensional vector)
```

### **4. Storage in Firebase**
```javascript
// Store with metadata
{
  id: "user123_biology_chapter5_chunk_0",
  content: "Photosynthesis is the process...",
  embedding: [0.1, -0.3, 0.7, ...],
  metadata: {
    title: "Biology Chapter 5",
    subject: "Biology",
    chapter: "Photosynthesis",
    userId: "user123"
  }
}
```

## 🤖 **AI Integration**

### **How AI Uses Uploaded Documents:**

#### **1. Student Asks Question**
```
Student: "What is the equation for photosynthesis?"
```

#### **2. Vector Search**
```javascript
// Search user's documents
const results = await vectorSearch(query, userId);
// Finds relevant chunks about photosynthesis
```

#### **3. Enhanced AI Prompt**
```javascript
const enhancedPrompt = `
Based on the student's uploaded materials:
${relevantContent}

Student's question: ${question}

Provide answer using their specific documents.
`;
```

#### **4. Personalized Response**
```
AI: "Based on your uploaded Biology notes, photosynthesis has the equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2. According to your Chapter 5 materials..."
```
