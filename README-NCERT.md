### Storage Structure

NCERT data is stored in both Firebase and local backup:

1. **Firebase Storage**:
   - Firestore collection: `ncert/{className}/{subject}/{chapterName}`
   - Each chapter document contains metadata
   - Questions stored in subcollection: `questions`
   - PDF backups in Firebase Storage

2. **Local Backup**:
   - Directory structure: `data/ncert/{className}/{subject}/`
   - JSONL files: `{chapterName}.jsonl`
   - Each line contains a JSON object representing a question

### PDF Processing

The system processes PDFs through these steps:

1. PDF is uploaded and temporarily stored
2. Text is extracted using pdf-parse
3. Questions and answers are identified using pattern matching
4. Structured data is saved to Firebase and local backup
5. Temporary files are cleaned up
