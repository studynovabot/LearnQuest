# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem
The frontend deployed on Vercel was trying to make API calls to relative URLs (`/api/health`, `/api/tasks`, etc.) but there's no backend running on Vercel to handle these requests. The backend is deployed separately on Render.

## Solution
Updated the frontend configuration to point to the correct Render backend URL.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Frontend Configuration
- **File**: `client/src/config.ts`
- **Change**: Modified `getApiUrl()` to use the Render backend URL in production
- **New URL**: `https://learnquest-backend.onrender.com`

### 2. Updated Environment Variables
- **Files**: 
  - `client/.env.production`
  - `.env.production`
- **Added**: `VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://learnquest-backend.onrender.com`

### 3. Updated TypeScript Definitions
- **File**: `client/src/vite-env.d.ts`
- **Added**: `VITE_BACKEND_URL` to the interface

## Vercel Environment Variables Setup

To ensure the frontend works correctly, you need to set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add the following variables:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://learnquest-backend.onrender.com
VITE_API_URL=https://learnquest-backend.onrender.com
VITE_NODE_ENV=production
```

## Testing the Fix

After the deployment completes, the frontend should:
1. ✅ Successfully connect to the backend health check
2. ✅ Load tasks, tutors, and other data from the API
3. ✅ Allow user authentication and registration
4. ✅ Display proper error messages instead of 404s

## Expected Behavior

Before fix:
- ❌ `GET https://learn-quest-eight.vercel.app/api/health 404 (Not Found)`
- ❌ All API calls returning 404 errors

After fix:
- ✅ `GET https://learnquest-backend.onrender.com/api/health 200 (OK)`
- ✅ All API calls working correctly

## Verification Steps

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Check that API calls are going to `https://learnquest-backend.onrender.com/api/*`
5. Verify that responses are successful (200 status codes)

## Backup Plan

If the Render backend is not responding, the frontend will show appropriate error messages and allow users to continue with limited functionality using cached data.
