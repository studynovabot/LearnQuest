# Admin User Management Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of admin user management features in LearnQuest, including:

1. Setting up the admin user with full feature access
2. Creating a user management dashboard for admins
3. Implementing subscription plan tracking

## Admin User Configuration

The admin user has been configured with the following credentials:

- **Email**: thakurranveersingh505@gmail.com
- **Password**: India#321
- **Role**: admin
- **Subscription Plan**: goat (highest tier)
- **Subscription Status**: active
- **Subscription Expiry**: 1 year from now

This configuration ensures the admin user has access to all features in the system, including:

- All admin-only features
- All premium features from the Goat subscription plan
- User management capabilities

## User Management Dashboard

A comprehensive user management dashboard has been implemented at `/admin-users`, which provides:

### User List View
- View all registered users
- Filter by subscription plan, role, and other criteria
- Sort by various fields (last login, creation date, etc.)
- Pagination for handling large numbers of users

### User Statistics
- Total user count
- Active users (last 30 days)
- New users (last 7 days)
- Subscription distribution (Free, Pro, Goat)
- Conversion rate statistics

### Implementation Details

1. **API Endpoint**: Created `api/admin-users.js` to handle:
   - Fetching users with pagination and filtering
   - Calculating user statistics
   - Admin-only access control

2. **Admin UI**: Created `client/src/pages/AdminUsers.tsx` with:
   - Tabbed interface for list and statistics views
   - Filtering and sorting controls
   - Responsive design for all device sizes

3. **Navigation**: Added to the admin sidebar under "User Management"

4. **Access Control**: Protected with `AdminRoute` to ensure only admins can access

## Subscription Plan Tracking

Enhanced the user model to track subscription details:

```typescript
interface User {
  // Existing fields
  id: string;
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  isPro: boolean;
  
  // New subscription fields
  subscriptionPlan?: 'free' | 'pro' | 'goat';
  subscriptionStatus?: 'active' | 'trial' | 'expired' | 'canceled';
  subscriptionExpiry?: Date;
  
  // Other fields
  // ...
}
```

This allows for:
- Tracking which plan each user is on
- Monitoring subscription status
- Handling expiration dates
- Supporting the feature access control system

## Usage

### Accessing User Management

1. Log in as the admin user (thakurranveersingh505@gmail.com)
2. Navigate to the admin section in the sidebar
3. Click on "User Management"

### Managing Users

The user management dashboard allows admins to:
- View all registered users
- See when users last logged in
- Monitor subscription status
- Track conversion rates
- Analyze user growth

## Security Considerations

- All admin routes are protected with the `AdminRoute` component
- The admin-users API endpoint is protected with the `requireAdmin` middleware
- Admin status is verified on both client and server sides
- Only users with the admin role or specific email addresses have access

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the user management system:
- User editing capabilities
- Manual subscription management
- User activity logs
- Detailed analytics on feature usage
- Export functionality for user data
