Chapter 1: Introduction to Physics
Physics is the fundamental science that seeks to understand how the universe works. It deals with matter, energy, motion, forces, space, and time.

Key Concepts:
- Matter: Anything that has mass and occupies space
- Energy: The capacity to do work or cause change
- Force: A push or pull that can change an object's motion
- Motion: Change in position over time

Chapter 2: Mechanics
Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects and the forces that cause motion.

Newton's Laws of Motion:
1. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F = ma).
3. Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Chapter 3: Energy and Work
Work is done when a force causes displacement. Energy is the ability to do work.

Types of Energy:
- Kinetic Energy: Energy of motion (KE = 1/2 mvÂ²)
- Potential Energy: Stored energy due to position or configuration
- Mechanical Energy: Sum of kinetic and potential energy
- Conservation of Energy: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed
